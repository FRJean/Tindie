This standalone boot loader is easier to use than a shield because the software 
to load the bootloader is already loaded on the device.

Simply open the Arduino IDE, select the type of bootloader you wish to load (atmega328 or atmega168).
, Select Tools->Programmer->Arduino as ISP and 
Select Tools->Burn Bootloader.
